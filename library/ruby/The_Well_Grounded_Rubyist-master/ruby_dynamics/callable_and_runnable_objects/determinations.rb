p 'Proc objects are self-contained code sequences that you can create, store, pass around as
method arguments, and, when you wish, execute with the call method. Lambdas are similar to Proc
objects. Truth be told, a lambda is a Proc object, but one with slightly special internal engineering.
The differences will emerge as we examine each in turn. Method objects represent methods extracted
into objects that you can, similarly, store, pass around, and execute.'
