puts



# Quantifiers let you specify how many times in a row you want something to match

# Anchors let you stipulate that the match occur at a certain structural point in
# a string (beginning of string, end of line, at a word boundary(borders), and so on)

# Modifiers are like switches you can flip to change the behavior of the
# regexp engine; for example, by making it case-insensitive or altering how it handles whitespace.
